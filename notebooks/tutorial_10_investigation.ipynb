    "*\"A pattern?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Everything in the Quarry has a pattern. The yellers move in primes—2, 3, 5, 7. The creatures follow depth and season. Even the disasters have rhythms.\" She leaned forward. \"I want you to find the pattern in these disappearances. Use everything we've taught you. Cross-reference the catches, the incidents, the creature sightings, the prices. Find the connections.\"*\n",

    "2. **Location Analysis**: Where exactly did they happen? What else happens in those areas?\n",

    "4. **Yeller Pattern Analysis**: Do the numbers involved follow yeller patterns (2, 3, 5, 7, 11)?\n",
    "5. **Cross-Reference Analysis**: How do the disappearances relate to other incidents, catches, and prices?\n",
