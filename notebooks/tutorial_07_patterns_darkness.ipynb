    "\n",
    "1. Create pivot tables with `pd.pivot_table()`\n",
    "2. Use crosstabs for frequency analysis\n",
    "3. Apply multiple aggregation functions\n",
    "4. Add margins (totals) to your tables\n",
    "5. Find patterns in categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you will be able to answer questions like:\n",
    "- What types of incidents occur most often in each sector?\n",
    "- Is there a relationship between time of day and incident severity?\n",
    "- What patterns exist in the disappearance data?\n",
